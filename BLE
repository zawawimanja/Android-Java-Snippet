BLE: Android built-in platform to discover devices, request and transmit information from our bluetooth device.

GATT: Generic Attribute Profile to define how to exchange data using predefined attributes.

Central: the Computer/Tablet/Mobile device, also referred as GATT client. Scans, requests and uses the data given by the peripheral.

Peripheral: the device broadcasting the data, also referred as GATT server. The data is structured as definitions of how to interact with it’s ‘database’.

Services: set of provided features and associated behaviors to interact with the peripheral. Each service contains a collection of characteristics.

Characteristics: definition of the data divided into declaration and value. Using permission properties (read, write, notify, indicate) to get a value.

Descriptor: an optional attribute nested in a characteristic that describes the specific value and how to access it.

UUID: Universally Unique ID that are transmitted over the air so a peripheral can inform a central what services it provides.

BLE device remains in sleep mode constantly except for when a connection is initiated. The actual connection times are only a few ms, while Bluetooth takes ~100ms. The reason the connections are short is that the data rates are high at 1 Mb/s.
