What is Utility Class? Utility Class, also known as Helper class, is a class, which contains just static methods, it is stateless and cannot be instantiated. It contains a bunch of related methods, so they can be reused across the application 


class MyUtilities{
    public static String foo(String bar){
        return bar.toUppercase;
    }
}
Then, on your activity:

MyUtilities.foo("baz");
