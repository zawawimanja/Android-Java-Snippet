The most common type of Bluetooth socket is RFCOMM, which is the type supported by the Android APIs. RFCOMM is a connection-oriented, streaming transport over Bluetooth. It is also known as the Serial Port Profile (SPP).

, 'core bluetooth' on ios only supports BLE devices and only on a rather high level. there is only one specific profile being offered (GATT)

Now if you want RFCCOMM (part of SPP) you might be able to leverage the 'External Accessory' framework BUT you can only use only your app with a your device (as in: you manufactured it and now wrote an app to use it). You would also need a license from apple so ....... not really an option
