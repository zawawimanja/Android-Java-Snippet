Bindservice()
Startservice()

A service is a component which runs in the background without direct interaction with the user.
As the service has no user interface, it is not bound to the lifecycle of an activity.

Services are used for repetitive and potentially long running operations, i.e., Internet downloads, checking for new data, data processing
, updating content providers and the like.
