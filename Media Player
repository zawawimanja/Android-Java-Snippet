//if media player not working need to copy raw folder from project that already work using media player


mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(quizActivityOne.this,R.raw.click);
                mediaPlayer.start();
                //My logic for Button goes in here


//when multiple click media player will stop..need to release it
                mediaPlayer.setOnCompletionListener(new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener(){
                    // @Override
                    public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer arg0) {
                        mediaPlayer.stop();
                        mediaPlayer.release();

                    }
                });


//different audio will cause the null pointer eventhough already converting it
